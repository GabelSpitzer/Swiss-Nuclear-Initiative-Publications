Below are the apngs for Swiss CO2 emissions, annualised and cumulative based on data from [Global Carbon Budget (2023)](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/5301/2023/), though the Swiss-specific data is more easily available at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/switzerland). Beyond 2022 the trend lines are purely linear trends, running towards net-zero at 2050. The ES2050+ has a nigh linear trend in their assumed GHG emissions towards net-zero, so the purely linear assumption is at least in line with that.
