### Read Me/FAQ

### What do we write about?

We make popular science articles on Swiss electricity sources. Our analysis covers hydropower, solar panels, nuclear reactors and more, highlighting their  advantages and disadvantages in the Swiss context.

### What are our article’s objectives?

We want to facilitate discourse on the economic, environmental and social impacts of power generation. Our articles are meant to share knowledge in a transparent and easy to understand way, without compromising the quality of information.

### Who are we?

We’re a passionate and internationally diverse group of researchers, educators and writers. While none of us are Swiss nationals, we all live in or have close ties to Switzerland. We think this allows us to maintain a unique and balanced perspective on national issues.

Our interest in the electricity industry was sparked by recent changes in the international energy landscape. As independent and self-taught researchers, we hope to find effective solutions for modern problems, including global warming, energy insecurity and disruptions in international energy trade. 

### What are our biases?

We think that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a huge priority for Switzerland. It is also our belief that nuclear power is an important part of the Swiss green energy puzzle. That being said, we appreciate that nuclear safety, reactor costs and radioactive waste are important issues to consider. Some of us used to be anti-nuclear for these reasons.

### Why is science communication necessary?

We know from experience how confusing energy policy can be. To make informed voting decisions, citizens need good information on electricity sources, greenhouse gas emissions, energy security and the green energy transition.

While many technologies seem tempting on paper, they often come with hidden downsides. We have to examine all options to find the best path, bearing in mind that there are no perfect solutions to Switzerland’s energy problems.

### How do we conduct our research?

We look for reliable sources to provide us with information. These include:

- **Scientific research,** such as this paper by Hirshberg et al. on the health effects of electricity generation: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095183201500277X).
- **Important institutes,** such as Swissgrid (h[ttps://www.swissgrid.ch/en/home.html](https://www.swissgrid.ch/en/home.html)), the organisation responsible for Switzerland’s electricity network.
- **Specialised news websites,** like [globalwitness.org](http://globalwitness.org) for news on environmental and social issues related to power generation, or [www.world-nuclear-news.org](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org) for information on developments in nuclear technology.
- **Swiss-specific news sites,** like ****[https://www.swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/).
- **Scientific literature reviews and summaries** published by institutions we trust, like the International Energy Agency ([https://www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/)).
