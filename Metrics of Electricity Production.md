# Metrics of Electricity Production
Modern grids don't typically consist solely of a single electricity production technology. Different technologies serve different roles within the grid, some of them supply a cheap and stable supply, some of them have very low emissions but are difficult to control, some excel at providing electricity quickly on demand. We will try to explain some of the most relevant decision-guiding metrics of electricity producing technologies in this article.

## Introductory information and some examples: Life-cycle assessments and project lifetimes
To understand the meaning of many of the parameters below it is important to know that they are usually evaluated over the life cycle of a project. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of a project usually starts with the mining of the materials necessary for the equipment and ends in the recycling or disposal of all materials used in the project (this is called "cradle to grave"). Knowing whether an LCA is taking the "cradle to grave" approach or not is very important in order to understand the meaning of the results. Comparing the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a coal-fired power plant with a similarly sized solar PV installation will yield very different results if you include the emissions from the production of the power plant and solar panels or if you are only looking at operating emissions (i.e coal being burned vs a solar panel just existing). In order to produce comparable numbers we usually take the impacts of a project over its lifetime and divide them by the power produced throughout its lifetime.
