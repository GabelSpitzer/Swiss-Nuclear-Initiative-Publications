### Endless Negotiations? Why Switzerland does not have an electricity deal with the EU 

An electricity deal guarantees that two entities can buy and sell electricity from each other. Key Swiss institutions, like Swissgrid [1], are adamant that Switzerland cannot meet its energy needs without an electricity deal with the European Union (EU). For their part, EU officials have been negotiating with the Swiss government for more than two centuries[2]. And yet, despite many years of talks, a Swiss-EU electricity deal has not materialized.

If an electricity deal with the EU is so important, why hasn’t Switzerland secured it yet? This is the question we will try to answer. In this article, we will provide a brief history of Swiss-EU negotiations, and explain the key reasons why an agreement has not been reached.

### The starting point: Switzerland before the EU

Before the formation of the EU, the largest European electricity grid was run by the UCPTE (Union for the Coordination of Production and Transmission of Electricity)[2]. Switzerland was a founding member of the UCPTE in 1958, and its “Star of Laufenburg” control centre in Argau was the heart of the UCPTE grid. At this point, Swiss businesses were highly influential in European electricity politics[2].

### The birth of the EU: New conditions for grid members

After the creation of the EU, the European Commission (EC) took a more and more active role in deciding how the European electricity system should be run[2]. As a non-EU member state, Switzerland has no control over the EC’s decisions. While the EU became more important, Switzerland’s influence over European electricity politics gradually waned[2].

New EU legislation set three important conditions (among others) for member countries of the expanding European grid. Meeting these three requirements would have helped Switzerland obtain an electricity deal[2]:

- **TSO:** Member states should have or create a transmission systems operator (TSO), an institution responsible for managing the entire country’s electric grid infrastructure[2].
- **Legal unbundling:** The member state’s TSO should be a government-regulated monopoly, while the countries electricity should be supplied by competing private companies. EU legislation mandates that the two should remain seperate: for example, the TSO cannot be owned by private electricity companies[2].
- **Liberalised electricity markets:** member states are obliged to open up their electricity markets, allowing consumers to purchase power from whomever they want[2].

Unfortunately, Switzerland was not successful at meeting all of these conditions. 

- Many Swiss businesses owned different parts of the electricity grid. For a long time, they were unwilling to give up their assets [2], although they ultimately merged their parts of the electricity network into Swissgrid in 2005. Switzerland created the desired TSO, but only after a significant delay.
- Because it is owned by the private electricity companies that created it, Swissgrid is not legally unbundled [2]. Unless this changes, Switzerland is unlikely to ever meet this EU requirement.
- Switzerland's 2002 referendum on liberalising the electricity market failed [2]. However, later legislation did free up the markets to some extent. Currently, only large electricity consumers (over 100,000 kWh) can choose their electricity producers[3], meaning that the Swiss electricity market remains only partly liberalised.

These differences with EU policy put a strain on negotiations. However, Switzerland might have still secured a deal if it weren’t for two political disasters, which severely harmed Swiss-EU relations.

### The two disasters: The Italian blackout and the 2014 referendum

In 2003, a tree fell on a Swiss electricity transmission line[4]. This started a complicated chain of events, ending in the isolation of the Italian grid (which the Swiss grid is closely connected to) from the European electricity system. The resulting Italian blackout caused an estimated 1,2 billion Euros in damages [2].

Switzerland was criticized for (allegedly) not responding to the warning signs quickly enough, and for not having an unbundled TSO [2]. While an official investigation of the crisis ruled that Switzerland was not accountable for the damages[2], the event soured Swiss-EU relations. Furthermore, it encouraged the EC to develop stricter regulations for grid members [2]. This hands-on approach did not favour Switzerland, as more legislation increased the EU’s control (and so reduced Swiss influence) over European electricity politics.

Regardless, Switzerland and the EU continued to negotiate. The plan was to reach a general agreement on a host of issues, including immigration and electricity trade. By 2014, the two parties had almost reached a deal[2]. However, a referendum decided that Swiss authorities should limit the immigration of EU citizens into Switzerland. This greatly upset EU officials, as it directly conflicted with a prior agreement, and led to a halt of negotiations[2]. Switzerland was excluded from important EU grid-balancing mechanisms, which makes it harder to maintain Swiss grid stability [2].

### Recent negotiations: The 2021 termination and the future

In 2021, Switzerland ended another, seven-year set of negotiations with the EU [5]. Swiss officials did not want the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction over Swiss-Eu agreements and thought that the Swiss populous would reject an EU demand for permanent residence and social security for EU immigrants [6]. Furthermore, it was argued that the deal did not do enough to ensure a level playing field for Swiss businesses, although EU officials maintained that they offered less favourable terms to the UK after Brexit[6].

In 2024, the EU and Switzerland restarted negotiations. A notable change is that Switzerland now accepts the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over a possible electricity agreement, removing one obstacle in the way of a deal [7]. Another promising sign is that the electricity deal is being negotiated separately from issues like immigration[7], potentially preventing a repeat of the 2014 referendum crisis. However, many issues still need to be resolved, and until they are, we cannot know if this round of negotiations will prove successful.

### Conclusion

The history of the Swiss-EU negotiations is very complicated, although we can identify several important trends. The rise of the EU, coupled with a decline in Swiss influence, meant that Switzerland would increasingly need to match regulations set by EU legislators. But, for a variety of reasons, Switzerland was slow or unable to adapt. Issues such as the Italian blackout, EU immigration and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice put further strain on Swiss-EU relations, even when they were not directly related to the electricity deal. While both sides would benefit from a deal, it remains to be seen whether the current round of negotiations can lead to a mutually satisfactory outcome.
