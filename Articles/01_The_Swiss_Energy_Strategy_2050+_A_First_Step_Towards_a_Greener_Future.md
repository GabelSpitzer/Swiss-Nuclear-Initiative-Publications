## **The Swiss Energy Strategy 2050+: A First Step Towards a Greener Future**

An electric vehicle in your garage and a solar panel on your roof. This is what your future may look like, according to the Swiss government’s Energy Strategy 2050+[1]. While the plan has undergone serious changes, the original strategy still forms the basis of the current Swiss energy policy. Read on to learn more about this initial plan, which aimed to help prevent further climate change while ensuring Switzerland’s continued prosperity.

## **Why is the 2050+ strategy necessary and what would it change?**

Our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are resulting in climate changes which, if we continue down this path, will cause great harm to societies across the world. To help prevent this, Switzerland has signed the Paris Agreement, an international treaty designed to keep the changes to our planet within acceptable margins. Consequently, the main goal of the government’s Energy Strategy is to reduce Swiss emissions to net-zero by 2050.

Documents such as the “Energy Perspectives 2050+”[1] described possible paths Switzerland could take to achieve that goal. Most probably, your future will include:

- an electric vehicle (EV) in your garage
- solar panels on your roof
- a heat pump instead of a gas or oil heater in your home
- partly hydrogen- and biogas-powered industry and public transport
- Electricity supplied by green energy sources
- large electricity imports from the EU during winter

These changes would come with some added costs. If the pre-2050+ strategy policies remained in place, future investments into the energy sector for maintenance, planned construction and electricity purchases would amount to 1400 billion CHF, with the basic version of the old 2050+ strategy costing an additional 73 billion CHF. However, the government promised that these expenses will reduce emissions while maintaining Swiss energy supply and independence.

## **The current biggest emitters and what they will be replaced with**

Transportation, industry, household heating and agriculture all contribute significantly to Swiss greenhouse gas emissions. The figure below shows historic annual emission values for Switzerland (excluding some emitters such as international aviation) and also provides the projected emissions from the original Swiss Energy Strategy 2050+’s base-case scenario[4].

The last two categories (CCS and NET) refer to activities which capture emissions at their source or directly from the air, and the store them in long-term repositories. CCS is Carbon Capture and Storage and NET refers to direct air CCS.

The Swiss government will seek to lower emissions in two ways: by making power generation more green (more on that in the next section) and by reducing the amount of energy that is consumed in the first place. Transportation, cooking and home heating will be electrified, which results in less pollution and more efficient energy consumption. Energetically wasteful fossil fuel cars, gas cookers and oil heaters will largely be replaced with electric vehicles, stoves and heat pumps. Better home insulation is another of the many ways in which efficiency will be raised across all sectors.

## **Where does your energy currently come from and where will it probably come from?**

The Swiss energy mix is currently dominated by fossil fuels, with electricity from power plants only accounting for 24% of final energy consumption. However, as the graph above illustrates, petroleum and natural gas use will almost fall away entirely by 2050. Conversely, electricity generation from green energy sources, the use of other renewables (biogas and heat pumps are included under this heading), electricity-based energy carriers (like green hydrogen) and district heating will increase considerably in the future[6].

Currently, Swiss electricity generation depends largely on hydroelectric and nuclear facilities. While hydro will remain prevalent, nuclear power plants will likely be phased out by 2035. To compensate for this, the initial plan envisaged that the Swiss electricity grid would be expanded in the following ways:

1. An enormous investment in Solar PV rooftop installations
2. A marginal expansion of hydroelectric power
3. Large solar PV farms in the Alps, wind turbine installations and geothermal projects
4. Expansion of the electricity grid for more energy storage and greater throughput of electricity 

Unfortunately, this strategy would have made it difficult to match electricity supply with demand. Solar PV panels produce the vast majority of their power when under direct sunlight, and so their productivity usually peaks around mid-day and during summer. However, Swiss energy consumption is highest during winter and low at noon when everyone is at school or at work. Therefore, solar will not produce electricity when it is needed most.

Switzerland should be able to alleviate this problem during summer. Batteries and hydroelectric pumps can store solar-produced electricity, releasing it again when demand rises. Hydro dams can also generate more power at times when solar falls off.

However, the old plan would struggle to produce enough electricity during winter. Instead, the government aimed to import even more electricity from its EU neighbours during the winter season. While more solar farms in the Alps or wind turbines throughout Switzerland could be built to minimise this winter EU electricity dependence, this is proving difficult due to intense public push-back[7][8]. As such, under the original plan, Switzerland would remain highly reliant on its neighbours to meet its green electricity needs.

## **Conclusions**

Switzerland is aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The original 2050+ strategy shows several paths through which this goal could be reached, focusing on realistic technologies existing today while minimizing added costs. Hydropower and solar PV rooftop installations formed the bulk of the proposed future Swiss electricity generation, supplying indoor heating and electric vehicles. The focus on electrification and efficiency are crucial to reducing Swiss emissions, though the heavy reliance on the EU for electricity in winter could have resulted in difficult situations in the future.
