### Everything you need to know about the Swiss electric grid

The grid is a critical part of the Swiss energy system. It connects power stations with consumers, and serves to match electricity supply with demand. In this article, we will see how the Swiss grid works, which kinds of power plants it can be connected to, and how it’s integrated into the EU grid.

### **How electrical grids work**

At its most basic level, an electric grid is a system that transmits electricity from power sources to consumers. For example, a generator (the power source) may be linked to a light bulb (the energy consumer) through a copper wire system (the grid). However, real life grids are far more complex systems, which may be connected with power plants, electricity storage, and even other electricity grids.

These complications arise because of a simple fact: grids must closely match electricity supply with demand. Grids operate around an agreed frequency (measured in Hz), which increases when there is an oversupply of electricity, and decreases when there is a shortage. While small, harmless fluctuations occur constantly, large ones can cause extreme damage to electrical equipment. In a simplified example, if the grid frequency doubles, a washing machine could spin twice as fast, leading to risk of serious malfunction.

Real-life industrial facilities are designed to automatically switch off when the grid frequency deviates too heavily from the norm. Since this may take the grid’s power plants offline (and even cause equipment failure), operators will forcibly reduce electricity consumption before automatic shutdowns can happen. During the 2003 Italian electricity crisis, the grid’s frequency dropped by more than 2,5 Hz, triggering nationwide blackouts[1]. To avert such disasters, the produced electricity should not deviate from demand by more than 1% - a serious challenge for any grid operator.

Grid operators use data, like in the graph below, to predict electricity consumption. Due to increased heating needs, winter electricity use is much higher than in summer. A cold period, or other changes in the weather, can also change how citizens use electricity. Furthermore, most power is used in the mornings and evenings (when people are at home and cooking meals), leading to a lull in demand during the afternoon and night[2].

A good energy grid needs to be able to take all of these predictable fluctuations into account. However, electricity production also must be flexible enough to deal with sudden changes in demand. These range from clouds passing over many solar panels to the outright failure of a power plant or transmission line.

### How does electricity production stay flexible?

To deal with changing electricity demands, grids are connected to two broad types of power plants. The first, “base load” power[3], is operated around the clock and used to meet a grid's minimum electricity needs. While energetically efficient and cost effective, base load power is quite inflexible to changing demand, as it cannot be turned on and off on a daily basis. To meet sudden increases in electricity consumption, grids are usually connected to “ramping” power plants [4], which can quickly change between low and high power production.

However, not all electricity production fits neatly into these categories. Wind and solar power produce electricity in unpredictable patterns that may not match local demand. Together, these power sources are referred to as “variable renewables”[5].

When excess electricity is produced, the grid operators may ask power plants or renewable installations to scale back their electricity production. Since this can waste valuable energy, grid operators may invest in electricity storage, such as batteries or pumped hydro installations.

An undersupply of electricity can be much more damaging. Forcing consumers to reduce their electricity use can result in reduced economic output, stalled industries, and risks to human health. To prevent energy shortages, grid operators may commission additional reserve power plants, or import electricity from other grids to make up the difference.

### **Switzerland and the EU grid**

Continental Europe has a highly integrated electricity grid[6], allowing easy imports and exports between included countries. European Union (EU) countries in the grid can use these to overcome shortcomings in their own electricity supply or gain revenue during periods of overproduction. EU governmental and commercial entities can also make power purchase agreements with EU electricity suppliers[7], ensuring that they can buy or sell electricity when needed.

While not an EU state, Switzerland is still heavily integrated with the electricity network of continental Europe. As seen in the figure above, the Swiss grid serves as a necessary flow-plate, transporting, for example, power from France and Germany down to Italy. Switzerland has historically traded a lot of electricity with its European neighbours.

## **Conclusion**

Maintaining a functioning grid is no easy task. To meet consumer demand, operators need to balance a variety of energy sources, possibly store energy, and often facilitate electricity trade. With the construction of more variable renewable, this will become more complex in the near future.
