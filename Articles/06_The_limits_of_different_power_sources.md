### The limits of different power plants

There are diminishing returns for every type of power source - the second hydro dam on the same river will be less cost efficient than the first. For this reason, it is best to diversify the nation’s power plants and renewables. However, Switzerland has reduced its share of options, by banning the construction of new nuclear reactors. Is it feasible to cut out this energy source out of the grid?

We will first discuss the various general factors that make it difficult (if not impossible), to rely on one type of electricity source alone. Then, we will provide our numbers on the limits of different power plants and renewables in the Swiss context, explaining which specific obstacles play the largest role for each power source. We conclude with a discussion on whether reaching net zero without nuclear is feasible.

## Why are there diminishing returns?

There are many factors that influence the economics of power plants. Any of the following may create diminishing returns for new projects:

- **Location.** Electricity producers, especially renewables, work best when placed in the ideal spot. Once all the best locations have been taken, new projects can expect lower returns.
- **Scarce Resources.** Power plants and renewables require specific fuel and construction materials. These may (suddenly) be in short supply, making it risky or costly to over-invest in one technology.
- **Land Use.** Large projects, like fields of wind turbines, may require more land than is easily available.

Another constraint has to do with the different roles power sources play within the grid. “Base load” power plants, like nuclear, natural gas and hydro, are ideal for cheaply meeting the grids’ minimum electricity needs. However, they are too inflexible to deal with changes in demand. “Ramp up” installations, on the other hand, are well suited for adapting to changing energy demands, but typically produce electricity less cost-effectively (the exception to this are hydro dams, which are both flexible and relatively cost effective). “Variable renewables”, like solar and wind, are good at neither of those things, since they produce electricity in unpredictable patterns.

It is impossible for a large grid to run only on base load power, as the power plants would be unable to match changing demand. Relying only on (non hydro) ramping power plants would be too expensive, as they are designed for flexibility, not cost effectiveness. While solar panels and wind turbines are relatively cheap to build, their unpredictability makes them somewhat difficult (or expensive) to integrate into the grid:

Large numbers of variable renewables come with two hidden infrastructure costs. Firstly, their unpredictable power production can lead to sudden surges of electricity in the grid. This can damage equipment or even lead to blackouts, unless proper investments in grid infrastructure have been made. Secondly, renewables are very seasonally dependent. Having a grid focused on solar, for instance, will lead to production shortages during the winter - unless large amounts energy can be stored via batteries or pumped hydro installations. For these two reasons, significant renewable expansion demands (potentially expensive) investments in grid infrastructure and energy storage. Therefore, a grid run purely on variable renewables is difficult to realise.

### **Scaling limits for Swiss renewables**

How much electricity could Swiss hydro, solar and wind installations feasibly produce? The graph below provides the TWh of electricity renewables could possibly provide - without making the grid operators bankrupt.

Switzerland will require around 45 TWh of internal electricity production by 2050. Renewables would be hard pressed to provide the entirety of Swiss electricity needs alone, for the following reasons:

- While flexible, **hydro** is constrained by the need for suitable rivers. Many locations already have dams, and some rivers are part of protected nature reserves.
- Good land for **solar** is difficult to secure, as the Swiss public is opposed to solar installations in the alps (the ideal location). Solar rooftop installations, while socially accepted, are less efficient and limited by available roof space.
- **Wind** is constrained heavily by available land. Swiss citizens do not want wind farms disturbing residential districts, natural environments or picturesque landscapes.

The government is taking steps to address these limitations. The approval processes for wind and solar parks is being streamlined, while subsidies have been offered to expand hydro to uneconomical locations. Even so, further hydro expansion is becoming quite costly, while heavy increases in wind and solar would require serious investments in grid infrastructure and perhaps seasonal electricity storage.

### Scaling limits for thermal power plants

Coal, nuclear and natural gas (CCGT) power plants are not renewable, and so run on limited resources. The graph below gives an estimate of how long the world could continue to keep using these power sources (using conventional fuel).

While the world contains finite amounts of coal and natural gas, new reservoirs continue to be discovered. This, alongside changes in consumption, makes it difficult to estimate how long these resources will last. That being said, we cannot simply burn all the world’s coal, oil and gas without causing catastrophic levels of global warming. Coal and gas power plants will increasingly need to be paired with carbon capture, though these technologies have yet to prove cost efficient.

Light water reactors (LWR) are currently the most popular nuclear power plants. At current rates of consumption, we will able to keep using them for at least the next 90 years. Fuel for fast breeder reactors, on the other hand, will be available for billions of years. As long as this proven technology is employed more, we are unlikely to ever run out of nuclear fuel.

### Can Switzerland do without nuclear?

Based on our numbers, scaled up Swiss hydro, solar and wind production could meet the country’s 2050 electricity demand. However, this will likely lead to increased costs in the form of grid infrastructure, possible energy storage, and an unprecedented level of wind and solar expansion. The country could lean even harder into hydro, though it is risky to bank almost exclusively on one power source.

In purely economic terms, it would’ve made sense to invest in the country’s nuclear fleet. Nuclear provides effective baseline power, and Switzerland already possesses the technical know-how to required to make them cost-competitive. However, the public is still divided on whether the construction of new nuclear power plants should remain banned, and, given prior decisions be the government, it would be politically challenging to pivot back to nuclear power.

### Conclusion

The government’s plan to run the country mainly on hydro, wind and solar power remains fully within the realm of possibility. However, the infrastructure requirements of variable renewables may make this plan expensive and difficult to implement. Supplementing these power sources with natural gas or nuclear would be economically advantageous, though of course there are many other factors to consider.
