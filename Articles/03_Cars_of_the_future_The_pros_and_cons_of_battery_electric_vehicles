# Cars of the future? The pros and cons of battery electric vehicles

Fossil-fueled motor vehicles account for 40% of Switzerland’s CO2 emissions[1]. To address this source of climate change, the government expects that most citizens will adopt battery electric vehicles by 2040[-1]. This article provides an explanation of this topical technology, and highlights its strengths and weaknesses when compared to conventional trucks and cars. We also provide a brief overview of why other electric vehicles have not proved as popular.

### What are battery electric vehicles?

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) typically use lithium-ion batteries[0]. These are charged with electricity, allowing the car to “refuel” with the help of charging stations or devices. This sets them apart from conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs), which run on CO2-emitting fossil fuels. 

### What are the advantages of BEVs?

Electric vehicles’ batteries can lead to two highly significant benefits.

- **Reduced Emissions.** While electric vehicles do not eliminate greenhouse gas emissions completely (some are still incurred during construction, usage, recycling and transportation of materials and parts[13]), they typically have a lower carbon footprint than other trucks and cars[13]. If their electricity is supplied solely by green energy sources, BEVs can considerably reduce Switzerland’s impact on the global climate.
- **High Efficiency.** Internal combustion engines waste a lot of energy in the form of heat. On the other hand, the electric motors used by BEVs can be more energetically efficient than all other road vehicles.

Because of their efficiency and lack of exhaust emissions, battery electric vehicles are important to the government’s energy strategy[-2]. Lower overall energy demands will make it easier to meet Swiss needs while reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emission.

### Are there any downsides to BEVs?

Given the impressive advantages of battery electric vehicles, one might imagine that other cars and trucks would soon become obsolete. However, they have some notable downsides.

- **Range.** With a median range of 400 km[10], BEVs cannot drive as far as fossil-fuelled vehicles. That being said, electric vehicle range has been steadily increasing[10], though the needed larger batteries may result in increased weight and higher greenhouse gas emissions during construction[14].
- **Cost.** EVs are currently more expensive than fossil-fueled alternatives. However, prices are decreasing, with some BEV cars already cheaper than fossil fuelled alternatives[-3]. Furthermore, some cantons are providing tax incentives and funding programs for purchasing BEVs[11], lowering the economic bar to entry. Charging EVs may also be used as batteries to help balance the local electricity grid[7], providing revenue for the vehicle’s owners.
- **Recharging Time.** EV charging devices can be used in public stations or installed at home[5]. However, the charging speed is capped by the ampere, the rate of electric flow. This may be limited at home, meaning that battery vehicles can take many hours to recharge. New Tesla charging stations, on the other hand, can restore 300 km worth of battery electricity within 15 minutes [4].
- **Difficulties Eliminating Emissions.** While BEVs have a lower carbon footprint than other options, they still release greenhouse gases during use and construction. For true climate neutrality, these greenhouse gas emissions would have to be counterbalanced by costly carbon capture operations.
- **Humanitarian Concerns.** BEVs require materials like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, the mining of which are currently associated with human rights abuses[9].

Like ICEs, electric vehicles release small particles as air pollution. As we detail in our upcoming article, [Airborne pollution: the invisible killer](https://www.notion.so/Airborne-pollution-the-invisible-killer-17b87aeeda224501a6fe3545a9c25f18?pvs=21), these can negatively affect the health of Swiss residents. All vehicle producing factories also produce harmful pollution, which, since Switzerland is currently importing all of its BEVs, can harm the citizens of other countries.

### Why alternative electric vehicles may not gain traction

Besides BEVs, two other types of electric vehicles that have gathered widespread interest.

- **Fuel cell electric vehicles** are powered by the oxidation of hydrogen, creating water and electricity. However, this process is very energetically inefficient, meaning that fuel cell cars and trucks will ultimately cost much more than battery electric vehicles[2]. They also inevitably leak hydrogen gas, which may have a global warming effect roughly equal to 11.6 times as much CO2[12].
- **Hybrid electric vehicles** are alternately powered by a fossil fuel engine and an electric battery. However, unlike pure battery electric vehicles, hybrids will not eliminate tailpipe CO2 emissions, and so will do less help to help address climate change.

Despite these downsides, these vehicles may outperform battery electric vehicles in certain circumstances. A fuel cell electric vehicle’s greater range [2], for example, may make it preferable for long-distance trucking[2].

### Conclusion

Since BEVs promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they represent a key technology for a more climate friendly future. That being said, range, cost, recharging time, and humanitarian concerns remain challenging problems to solve, and make other types of vehicles preferable in some circumstances.
