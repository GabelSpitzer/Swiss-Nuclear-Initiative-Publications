### The differences between power sources

Switzerland has employed a wide variety of electricity sources, including hydro, natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar[1]. This begs the question: Why not just focus on the best type of power plant? However, all electricity sources have unique limitations, and so are best combined with other types of power plants. In this article, we will discuss the key limiting factors of electricity sources and why these necessitate a diversified electricity grid.

### Resource and environmental requirements

Electricity doesn’t come from nothing. Many power plants require fuel, including natural gas, coal, biogas, and enriched uranium. Others need specific environmental factors to function, such as strong enough winds or sufficient sunlight. Lastly, building power plants, solar panels or wind turbines requires materials, which may not be easy to acquire.

In the Swiss context, the following power plants (and their resource constraints) are most relevant:

- **Hydropower facilities** work best with rivers that run through canyons or hilly terrain [2].
- **Solar panels** are ideally placed in unobstructed sunlight[3] and require rare earth elements to be constructed[4].
- **Wind turbines** are ideally paired with sufficiently strong winds[5], while their construction also needs rare earth elements[4].
- **Nuclear power** plants typically require enriched uranium fuel[6] and a nearby water source to cool the reactor[7].
- Combined cycle gas turbines typically run on natural gas, but can be fuelled by biogas as well[8]. They also require cooling from a nearby water source.

These constraints often make it impossible to focus purely on one technology. There are not enough suitable Swiss rivers and lakes, for example, to supply its electricity needs through hydropower alone. Over-relying on one resource can also lead to difficulties during an environmental, political or economic crisis, as was the case with Europe’s dependence on Russian gas[9].

### Matching supply and demand

The nation’s electricity generation and transmission system (its grid) needs to provide power at times when consumers use it. Too little electricity can lead to devastating shortages and energy insecurity, while too much power in the grid may seriously damage home [10a] and industrial [10b] electrical equipment [10]. To help match supply with demand, flexible “ramp up” power plants can be turned on and off[11] with only a few minutes notice.

However, thermal ramp up plants are less efficient (and more expensive) than less flexible options. “Base load” electricity sources, which produce a consistent electricity output over time[12], are often needed to keep costs low.

The last type of power plants, “variable renewables”, is highly unpredictable. Wind turbines’ and solar panels’ electricity output depends on the weather, which electricity suppliers have no control over[13]. However, variable renewables benefit the grid by providing cheap electricity (in the right conditions)[12.3][12.6] and reducing its carbon footprint[13].

The future grid will likely have to balance ramp up, base load and variable renewables. These include:

- **Ramp up:** Hydroelectric dams.
- **Base load:** Hydroelectric run-of-river power plants and dams, nuclear power plants, combined cycle gas turbines.
- **Variable renewables:** solar panels, wind turbines.

### Economic factors

Cost-effectiveness can and does affect which power plants are built and operated. Expenses depend on the following factors:

- **Fuel costs.** Some power plants require large amounts of fuel (like natural gas), the price of which varies between regions[14].
- **Construction costs.** Other power plants, such as nuclear and hydro, are very expensive to build. These require significant loans from investors, meaning that the cost of their electricity depends, in large part, on the discount rate[14].
- **Location.** When placed in the ideal spot, where, for example, the wind is strong and consistent, power plants can be noticeably more effective[14]. Conversely, once all the good locations have been taken, certain power plants can start becoming uneconomical.
- **Regulations.** Government subsidies can make power plants more viable, while extensive regulations and approval processes can mire projects in red tape. Construction delays increase the time needed for a project to be able to generate revenue and repay loans, which can greatly reduce profitability.

### Environmental and safety concerns

All electricity sources affect the environment in some way. Greenhouse gas emissions, while much higher for coal and natural gas fired power plants, are present across the board[16]. These alter the atmosphere’s cooling effect, leading to a harmful increase in the global surface temperature. Therefore, low emissions electricity sources like hydro, solar, wind and nuclear are desirable for a greener future.

Power plants may also disrupt local wildlife[17], disturb picturesque landscapes[18], or take space away from other important projects[17].

Sadly, all power plants incur at least some risk to human life. These unfortunately occur in smaller scale accidents or from constant pollution[19]. While extremely unlikely, large scale disasters like a hydro dam break or a nuclear meltdown can also cause devastating amounts of damage[19].

### Conclusion

In this article, we have seen some of the limitations facing different power plants, all of which have to be balanced to form a very successful grid. Given the complexity of the task, there is likely no single correct way to proceed. Instead, planners, politicians and voters must decide on their priorities, such as preventing greenhouse gas emissions or achieving energy security, and advocate for technologies that help achieve these goals. In our following articles, we will offer more direct comparisons of different electricity sources, bearing in mind that no single one of these can power the entirety of Switzerland.
