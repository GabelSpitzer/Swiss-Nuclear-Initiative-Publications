### How our electricty generation affects other countries

All electricity production has a human cost. Unfortunately, we often focus exclusively on the effects on our own country, including air pollution, noise, and hazardous waste. However, electricity production is a global industry, with mining and refining typically occurring overseas. In this article, we will explore the harm our electricity generation causes in other nations, both for humans and the environment. We end with a discussion on whether these problems are being solved.

As consumers, we are often unaware of how our energy is sourced. This is very understandable - global supply chains are rarely transparent, and we have limited control over how our power is produced. While these decisions are primarily in policymakers’ hands, knowing about them can still help us make more informed voting decisions.

### How does our electricity generation affect other nations?

Three factors cause the most damage internationally: **greenhouse gas emission*s,*** mining operations and mining waste. **Mining** is dangerous for workers, but its toxic byproducts, stored in so-called **“tailing dams”**, are often even more hazardous. Tailing dams are artificial lakes designed to contain a mining operation's liquid waste - and are often at risk of spilling their poisonous content into the surrounding environment. Since all energy production involves greenhouse gas emissions and mining to some extent, we need to examine all three of these aspects.

### The first problem: Greenhouse gas emissions from power generation

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, are some of the worst byproducts of power generation. They trap heat within the atmosphere, leading to a devastating increase in global temperature. The resulting climate change will bring about a variety of disastrous consequences:

- **Heat waves** have grown more intense and dangerous since the 1950s. [1] They caused an estimated 370 Swiss deaths in 2023 alone. [2]
- **Tropical cyclones** are becoming more frequent [1], as is the associated devastation and loss of life.
- **Compound events**, which combine multiple disasters, are increasing in number [1].

It is crucial to prevent more of these catastrophes, alongside droughts, floods, glacial melts and heavy rains. Therefore, we believe countries have a global responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

*CCGTs are combined cycle gas turbines, which can run on different combinations of coal, natural gas, oil, and synthetic gas or fuel.*

As we can see from the graph, coal and CCGT plants contribute greatly to global warming. But, while burning fossil fuels for electricity produces the most greenhouse gasses, no electricity source is entirely emission-free. Construction, transport, extraction and refining processes all contribute to a power plant’s lifetime emissions.

For example, a solar panel may be constructed in a Chinese factory, releasing carbon dioxide through its use of electricity from coal-fired power plants, then shipped to Switzerland, with the boats burning oil in the process. Additionally, mining and refining the minerals needed for the construction of solar panels requires large amounts of heat to be generated, leading to further pollution and emissions.

These background emissions certainly do not make coal or gas power plants look better than renewables - they are still many times more destructive. However, one should still be aware that all power plants release greenhouse gasses at some point during their life cycle - often in other countries - and compare them by their net contributions.

### The second problem: The humanitarian costs of mining

Power plants require a variety of materials for construction and operation, many of which need to be mined. Unfortunately, mining operations pose many dangers to workers, the environment and nearby human settlements.

Miners are frequently exposed to toxic substances, including radon, arsenic and cyanide. This may, however, not be the worst danger they face. Across the global supply chain, mining can involve a variety of human rights abuses. Minerals produced from these sources are notoriously difficult to trace, and crimes are not always well-known or documented.

A prominent example is the copper mining industry, which is frequently connected to forced or child labour, bribery and corruption, and support for dangerous armed groups. Metal extraction can be even more damaging: in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 15,7% of cobalt miners are children, while 20% work with little more than their hands. Unfortunately, cobalt is a key mineral for the green energy transition, with 70% of it being produced in the DRC. Unless action is taken, it is likely that these abusive mining practices will continue to be profitable.

However, not all mineral extraction leads to human rights abuses. Argentina has amongst the lowest reports of problematic mining despite being part of the risky gold and copper industries. Australia is similarly safe for miners while producing about 50% of the world’s lithium, a mineral critical for electric car batteries and green energy storage.

### The third problem: The environmental dangers of tailing dams


Mining of all types produces large amounts of toxic or radiactive waste. These operations begin by dredging up large amounts of ore, which then needs to be processed to obtain the desired materials. To extract them, the ore is ground into fine particles, then mixed with water and various dangerous chemicals. This process results in useful minerals (such as gold, copper or uranium), but also creates large amounts of toxic sludge.

Since it is hazardous to humans, animals, and the environment, the toxic waste produced by mining operations needs to be stored indefinitely. This is usually done by constructing tailing dams, which are relatively cheap when compared with other options. However, tailing dams have a major downside: they are prone to breaking or overflowing if not maintained properly.

As this graphic shows, there is an incredible amount of (potentially dangerous) tailing damn waste across the world:

![alt text](<../Images/06_/The World's mine tailings.jpeg>)

A catastrophic tailing dam break occurs every 2 to 3 years, leading to deaths, destroyed villages, water contamination, and ecological and environmental destruction. For example, the Mariana dam break in Brazil annihilated the village of Bento Rodrigues and might have permanently polluted the River Doce. Mining operations are often conducted in previously protected nature reserves or near indigenous populations, exacerbating the potential damage caused by a tailing dam break.

Mining tailing dams are numerous, and their toxic sludge cannot easily be contained. If the dam dries up, the content will turn to invisible noxious dust, which can easily blow towards villages, trees and animals. Too much water, on the other hand, will make dams overflow and spill part of their contents into the surrounding environment, as happened in the 2000 Baia Mare disaster in Romania. As such, tailings dams require careful planning and constant oversight [3]. 

Because of costs, tailing dams are rarely designed to be maintained indefinetely. However, this makes an eventual disaster all but inevitable. One solution, called backfilling, is to dry and store the waste in the original mine. While more expensive, this may be necessary to protect nature and human lives in the long term.

### What is being done to aleviate these problems?

The mining industry, which is a large greenhouse emitter, is beginning to use renewables to power its operations [5]. That being said, the greenhouse gas emissions produced during mining, refining and shippping of materials are difficult to prevent completely. To balance out the emissions it cannot stop, the Energy Perspectives 2050+ report predicts that Switzerland will use direct-air carbon capture technologies [4], which suck greenhouse gases directly from the atmosphere. This technology, while currently prohibitively expensive, is still a realistic and proven method for slowing global warming.

Some companies and initiatives are aiming to prevent human rights abuses in the mineral supply chain. Fuse Battery Metals seeks to establish alternatives for cobalt mining in North America (reducing the need to source from areas like the Congo), while the Responsible Mineral Initiative advocates for more ethical mining practices. Hopefully, these efforts can make the mineral supply chain more humane.

The mining industry is making some efforts to improve tailing dams[5]. However, there is much work to be done before the problem of mining waste is properly addressed. That being said, this is not all the mining industry's responsibility. By reducing use of mineral intense technologies, and increasingly recycling used minerals [5], Swiss society can reduce the need for potentially harmful mining operations.

### **Conclusion**

Since all power sources require construction and mining, humanitarian and environmental risks are present across the board. There are no easy solutions to these problems, which voters, businesses, governments and the global community will need to solve together. In the meantime, Switzerland can try to reduce its impact by consuming less minerals, by recycling or by using less mineral-intense technologies. In the electricity industry, wind turbines and solar panels require many mined materials, though of course these technologies have other advantages.
