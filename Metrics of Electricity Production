# Metrics of Electricity Production
Modern grids don't typically consist solely of a single electricity production technology. Different technologies serve different roles within the grid, some of them supply a cheap and stable supply, some of them have very low emissions but are difficult to control, some excel at providing electricity quickly on demand. We will try to explain some of the most relevant decision-guiding metrics of electricity producing technologies in this article.

## Introductory information
To understand the meaning of many of the parameters below it is important to know that they are usually evaluated over the life cycle of a project. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of a project usually starts with the mining of the materials necessary for the equipment and ends in the recycling or disposal of all materials used in the project (this is called "cradle to grave"). Knowing whether an LCA is taking the "cradle to grave" approach or not is very important in order to understand the meaning of the results. In transportation "cradle to grave" is often referred to as "well to wheel" but many of the LCAs in this industry report "tank to wheel", where impacts incurred before your vehicle is filled with fuel or electricity are not reported.
